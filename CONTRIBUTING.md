# Contributing to Resxume
We welcome contributions to ResXu! Whether you're a developer, designer, or just have a great idea for the project, we're happy to have you onboard.

# Submitting Issues
If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible, including:

- A detailed description of the problem or feature request
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
- Any relevant screenshots or screen recordings

# Making Changes
Before making any changes, please check the issue tracker to see if there is an open issue for the change you're planning to make. If there isn't, please open an issue first to discuss the change with the maintainers.

Once you have an issue open, you can start working on your changes. Here's a quick overview of the development process:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes
2. Make your changes, and be sure to include tests and documentation as appropriate
3. Commit your changes and push them to your fork
4. Open a pull request from your branch to the `develop` branch of the main repository

We'll review your pull request and give you feedback on any changes that need to be made. Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into `develop` and then `master` branch.
